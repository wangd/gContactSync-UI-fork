Don't open it/install in Firefox.  Please remember that this is a test release and will probably have bugs.  If you have any suggestions or run into any bugs, please let me know.</p>
  <p><strong>You can view the flash tutorial <a href="tutorial.html">here</a>, but there have been some changes since the tutorial was made.  I strongly suggest viewing the entire tutorial before trying to use gContactSync.</strong></p>
