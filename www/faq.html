<h3>What attributes does gContactSync synchronize?</h3>
<p>By default, it synchronizes the first four e-mail addresses (with their types), the 6 screennames in Google (with the protocol name) and every attribute in Thunderbird except for Custom 3 and Custom 4 along with several additional fields for e-mail addresses, screennames, and numbers added by gContactSync. Anything that is not synchronized is preserved.</p>
<p>Thunderbird has 6 address fields (two lines, the city, state, zip code, and country) for the home address and another 6 for the work address while Google only has one, which makes synchronizing addresses difficult. To solve this, gContactSync adds three new multi-lined fields to synchronize directly with the first home, other, and work addresses in Google. When a contact from Thunderbird is added to Google the new fields are filled from the old if they are empty. The new addresses, if present, replace the old ones when viewing a card.</p>
<h3>What are the requirements?</h3>
<p>gContactSync requires at least Thunderbird 2.0.0.8 (the current version is 2.0.0.16). It also works with every version of Thunderbird 3 so far (3.0a1 through 3.0b1pre, which includes the Alpha releases and support for Bug 413260).  If you use Thunderbird 3, I suggest using at least 3.0a2.</p>
<h3>Will gContactSync be able to synchronize multiple address books with multiple Google Accounts?</h3>
<p>Hopefully, yes, but not before the first version is released.  See <a href="https://www.mozdev.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=19715">Bug 19715</a> for details.</p>
<h3>Why can't I set extra attributes or types when creating a new card?</h3>
<p>Because doing so in versions of Thunderbird before 3.0b1pre would require a lot of work.  I might do this in the future, but it will be possible in Thunderbird 3.0.  See <a href="https://www.mozdev.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=19753">Bug 19753</a> for more information.</p>
